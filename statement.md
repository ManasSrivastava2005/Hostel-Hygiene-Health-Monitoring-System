# Project Statement  
### Hostel Hygiene & Health Monitoring System 🧹

---

## 📍 Problem Statement

Hostel facilities often struggle with *cleanliness and hygiene monitoring*, as complaints from students are generally verbal, ignored, or not properly recorded.  
Due to the absence of a structured system, *repeated issues in water quality, food safety, washroom maintenance, and mosquito control* may lead to serious health hazards such as jaundice, dengue, food poisoning, and skin infections.

---

## 🎯 Aim of the Project

To develop a *simple digital system* that allows students to submit hygiene complaints and enables hostel authorities to *analyze frequent problems* and identify *high-risk areas* using complaint-based data analytics.

---

## 🧠 Objectives

- Create a centralized platform to *record hygiene issues*
- Categorize complaints for better tracking and action
- Provide *risk analytics* to highlight possible diseases linked to each category
- Support hostel management in *decision making*
- Improve overall *health, safety, and hygiene* standards in hostels

---

## 🔍 Scope of the Project

- Applicable to *hostels, dormitories, PGs, and school hostels*
- Can be upgraded with:
  - Admin dashboard
  - Database or cloud storage
  - Mobile/Web application
  - Automated report generation
- Useful for internal hygiene monitoring and student welfare committees

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution

Design a *Python-based console application* that:
- Accepts complaints with category & description
- Stores and displays complaints in organized form
- Performs *risk analysis* based on frequency
- Predicts potential *health risks* (like jaundice, dengue, food poisoning)
  
This system creates awareness among students and helps administration take *timely action* to control hygiene-related problems.

---

## 📌 Expected Outcome

- Transparent hygiene reporting system
- Reduced health risks through early detection
- Improved cleaning and food management
- Data-driven hostel maintenance practices
- Higher student satisfaction and better living conditions

---

## 📎 Conclusion

The *Hostel Hygiene & Health Monitoring System* provides a practical and impactful solution to one of the most common problems in hostels. By combining simple technology with student participation, it enables *healthier, safer, and more hygienic hostel environments*.
